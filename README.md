# WiFi authentication subroutine for ESP8266

This is a simple project which helps you connect to a Wireless network using ESP8266 board through a serial monitor in a better way than hard coding your network's credentials in the main code. 

Everything here has been tested on a _NodeMCU ESP8266_ and it also may be working on ESP module mounted on an Arduino as well (let me know if you have tested it!)
